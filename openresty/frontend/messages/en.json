  "FAQ": {
    "title": "Answers to frequently asked <br></br> questions",
    "chapter1": "How much does it cost to develop a website and how long does it take?",
    "description1": "It is impossible to answer this question without clarification: it depends on the number of pages (1, 20 or, for example, 500), on the type of design (static or animated), and the availability of technical specifications or at least a general idea of the scope of work.Consider, for example, a business card site of 3-5 pages.  We break it down into categories: Freelance web designers charge an average of 20 thousand, although some may request up to 200 thousand for a landing page.  However, there is a risk of choosing an unreliable performer, and on exchanges only 2-3 out of 100 offers can be normal.  Deadlines are from 3 days, often these are template sites where many stages of work can be omitted.Web agencies or web design studios usually offer prices from 120 to 400 thousand.  It is important to note that they provide guarantees, work officially, and a team of specialists is working on the project, not one 3rd year student of linguistics.  Deadlines range from 30 days, although in large web studios with a large staff, the deadlines may be longer.  Professional agencies are not limited to just design.  They offer a whole cycle of tasks and an analysis system that allows you to create unique projects at a high level.  This includes not only the website, but also business analysis.  Super-creative design agencies, which are among the top 30 web studios on the Runet and provide premium services, can request prices from 500 thousand and above.  Here, payment includes not only the creation of a website, but also branding.  Terms - from 2 months.You can specify the price in our web studio by phone or calculate it yourself approximately.",
    "chapter2": "How to order a website and what will it take?",
    "description2": "Before ordering a website, it is important to prepare, especially if you are aiming for a high-quality product, and not for a regular template for minimal money. First of all, study your competitors: evaluate their websites, identify their strengths and weaknesses. Think about what exactly you want from your site, what purpose it should serve. Determine the basic functional requirements, such as feedback forms, the possibility of integrating payment systems, and the need to use a customer data management system (CRM). Gather all this information in a notebook so that you have a clear idea of what you need. This will help you communicate more effectively with developers and avoid misunderstandings in the process of creating a website. After you have prepared and decided on the basic parameters, you will be ready to order a website that meets your requirements and expectations.",
    "chapter3": "Why are we developing sites on DRF and NextJS?",
    "description3": "We chose to use Django REST Framework (DRF) to create the backend and Next.js is for the frontend for several important reasons.   <br> </br > 1. The power and Flexibility of DRF: - DRF provides us with powerful tools for creating web APIs.  This is important because we can effectively manage data, ensure its security and easily expand the functionality of our project.<br> </br>  2. Integration with Django: - DRF is deeply integrated with Django, which gives our project stability and reliability.  Django provides ease of development and a clear project structure.  <br></br> 3. Modern Features Of Next.js:- Next.js provides the use of modern technologies for the frontend, such as Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).  This allows us to improve the performance of our site and optimize its loading.  <br></br> 4. Easy Navigation and Responsiveness: - Next.js provides an intuitive way to create site navigation.  It also supports responsive designs, which is important to improve the user experience.  <br></br> 5. SEO-friendly Features: - Both technologies, DRF and Next.js, provide opportunities for creating SEO-friendly web applications.  This is important to increase the visibility of our site in search engines.   <br></br> Combining DRF and Next.js provides us with a balanced and effective toolkit for creating modern and high-performance web applications.  This allows us to achieve our development goals by ensuring the reliability, performance and responsiveness of our web application."
